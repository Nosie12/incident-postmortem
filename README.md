## 🧨 Impact Summary

- Remote code execution on `nbn.external.network`  
- HTTP POST request payload targeting `/tomcatwar.jsp`  
- Downtime and degraded performance for NBN services  
- High volume of customer complaints  

---

## 🕵️‍♂️ Root Cause

The attacker used a known **Spring4Shell PoC** to send HTTP POST requests with malicious query strings targeting a vulnerable endpoint. The payload enabled RCE (Remote Code Execution) via:

- Exploit: `Spring4Shell`  
- Path: `/tomcatwar.jsp`  
- Method: `POST`  
- Protocol: `HTTP/1.1`

## 🔍 Detection & Response Timeline

1. **Detection:** Firewall logs and customer complaints indicated abnormal behavior.  
2. **Triage:** Security Operations identified the issue and escalated it.  
3. **Analysis:** Firewall logs were reviewed; exploit pattern identified.  
4. **Response:** A custom firewall rule in Python was deployed to block the malicious payload.  
5. **Result:** Service restored, forensic investigation launched.
